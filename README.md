# palava stats

## About

This tool displays the statistics generated by palava-machine. We try to
collect as few information as possible. The statistics are available through a
web interface.

## Usage

Install with the following commands

	# initialize support (submodules, build, ...)
	./setup.sh

	# install dependencies
	npm install

To run the server simply use the start script

	./start.js

After this just open the webinterface in your favorite browser. The port which
is used is displayed as soon as the app is ready.

The application is configured through environment variables. Here is an example
on how to configure the port on which the app listens

	export BIND_PORT=8080

The following variables are available

* `BIND_PORT`: port on which the webinterface listens (default: 3000)
* `BIND_HOST`: host on which the webinterface binds (default: 0.0.0.0)
* `MONGO_HOST`: address of the mongodb server (default: localhost)
* `MONGO_DB`: database in which the data is stored (default: plv\_stats)

## Collected Data

The following data is collected by palava-machine:

* How many users spent how many minutes in a room
* How many rooms had which maximum size

Room names, user names, IP addresses etc. are not saved and there is no
connection between the user stats and the room stats.
